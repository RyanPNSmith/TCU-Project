Survival of the fittest simulation using a nerual network.

This project was created at the request of the Computer Science Department Chair. He requested a simulation made in Unity that incorporates Dijkstra's algorithm using a neural network. The first idea that came to mind was a "Survival of the Fittest" simulation. Using the knowledge I have in Blender, I created all of the assets by hand. While it may not be the prettiest, it is highly functional.

There is a speed control object in the file; please toggle that setting to your preference, as sometimes the AI takes a while to learn and adapt.
